# Reserve area, like an extra margin, on selected edges of the screen
# Use this if you want to save some area for something else, like status indicators or such
# (I use it for screenlets indicating CPU and network load, along the left hand side)

# default value: zero for all
# Note: defining displays below (usually for multi-display cases) overrides this setting

# Delay between adding new kodis, in seconds
# Empirically, some delay seems to be needed between starting kodis
# This can be expensive if you are opening a lot of kodis in a row
# Watch the CPU in System Monitor; if there's not enough delay, it seems to get stuck tangled up and use a lot of CPU for a long time
# Might be system-dependent; you could certainly try 0 or 1 and see what happens
# But keep an eye on the CPU monitor

# Delay between starting a kodi and positioning it, in seconds
# Seems to need this before the window is ready to be positioned, empirically
# Might be less on faster systems
# This can also be expensive, since each kodi is positioned after it is opened

# Delay between successive kodi removes, in seconds

# Seems to reduce the crashes when removing kodis

# Define displays for multiple-display setups, or other special cases
# If you don't define displays here, it assumes it's all one display, and works out the dimensions
# However, if you have multiple displays, it can't tell, so you have to tell it where each display is located in the workspace
# Note that this setting will override the 'reserve' settings (because you can reserve however you like, on a per-screen basis,
#  by adjusting these virtual display dimensions)
# arguments: x,y,width,height
# Uncomment the following lines, and fill in the numbers appropriate to your desktop arrangement
# (if you have more than two displays, you can add more lines in the same way)
# display 1 = 65,50,1855,1030
# display 2 = 0,1081,1280,720
